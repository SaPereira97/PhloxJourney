Phlox Journey
In a world far far away, shrouded in melancholy, amidst the delicate petals of cherry blossom trees and a dense bamboo forest, our lone protagonist Phlox Purple set of on a heart-wrenching journey to find his missing friends:

- Banana Yellow, La Salle Green, Bakers Brown, Beau Blue and Coquelicot Red.

While Phlox traverses the silent and misterious bamboo forest each obstacle proves to be more challenging than the last making the journey harder and full of despair.

Our hopeless little warrior must master the art of flight to overcome the terrible quest that is set upon him.

Will Phlox's tears stain the petals of the cherry blossoms, a silent lament for his never found companions, or will he find the preseverance and resilience to defy his fate and reunite with his lost friends?
